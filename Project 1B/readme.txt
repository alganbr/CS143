Objective:
The project is to build a website on movies, actors, and their reviews
supported by a relational database system.

Add records to the tables, create a dynamic form for adding actors, directors,
movies, movie-actor roles, movie-directors, and reviews for movies.

1 for the actors, 1 for movies, and 1 for both actors and movies. All the search
functionalities is being done in SQL and not using regular expression.
